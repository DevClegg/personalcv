    <h3>
      <li>
        Why do I want to learn this skill?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Learning this skill brings a chance to make everyone proud. I’ve been handed a lot in life, I want to work for something that I can proud of. I’ve quit too much. The salary with this career can be quite a generous one, but my end goal is to
        be able to retire early or go part-time so I can find the time to write my books and become a published author.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      <li>
        What will I achieve if I learn this skill?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I can start developing websites for aspiring authors, making connections for when I eventually come to publish my books. But, I need a stable income to support my family, while still being able to write my book (and not for 2 hours a night,
        which doesn’t work for me at all…).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Q3 -->
    <h3>
      <li>
        How will this skill change my life and my career?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I might find opportunities at Sharp where I can utilise these skills, maybe even earn a little more money. But I think the better option will be to seek greener pastures. What life experience will I really learn from staying with the same
        company all my life? How will my skills progress if I can’t utilise them on a daily basis?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Q4 -->
    <h3>
      <li>
        How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family, friends and coworkers?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I’d love to be able to treat my family and friends with the more money I earn. I want them to be proud of me and not just because I got over becoming an orphan at 24. I want the respect of my friends, family and co-workers. I know Lauren
        loves and respects me, but I want to have something she can really admire and potentially even be inspired by. I want to be able to treat my kids to whatever they want and only have to say no out of choice, not because finances are an issue..
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Q5 -->
    <h3>
      <li>
        How will I feel if I never accomplish this?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Disappointed. Disheartened. Depressed. It’ll just be another project unfinished, another scrunched up ball of A4 around the bin. I let my ADHD (or whatever I get diagnosed with) win. I certainly don’t benefit from it. My family doesn’t and
        neither do my goals.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Q6 -->
    <h3>
      <li>
        What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I wake up naturally, kiss Lauren and my kid’s good morning. Have breakfast when I want and not be under any real pressure to do so. Ideally be a freelancer, or work part time, having mastered HTML, CSS, JavaScript and any other language that
        will help me master the skill of web developing. I want to be in demand with a vast portfolio under my belt.
        I’d love to start a business with my friends and family, I think Jenk or Joe are the best choices, and Lauren (without question)
        The web development will be my stable income, what pays the bills. I’ll also be earning a rental income from the house at 9 Rochester Road, ideally, we’d have another property that provides additional income. The web development money will be
        added to savings or investment fund where this can build up.
        And for the rest of my free time that isn’t coding/family will be spent either writing my book or chilling tf out.
        But to do all that, learning web development is fundamental to achieving my goals.
