  <h2> Personal </h2>
  <p>
    I have a girlfriend called Lauren, whom I love dearly, together we have the
    perfect house and a little dog called Jazz. I aspire to become a published
    author one day but I'm currently struggling to find enough time to sit down
    and write. I'm hoping to earn enough money so that I may retire early or go
    part-time, so that I can find more time to write. Web development is a great
    career with many opportunities for me, I think it will be a positive creative
    outlet and a way to further my skills and career so that I can ultimately
    reach my goal of becoming an author. I hope to use my new skills to help other
    aspiring authors reach their dreams by creating personalised websites for them
    where they can market their books.

        <p>I am currently employed at <em>Sharp Business Systems UK PLC,</em> based
        in Wakefield. Originally, I was hired as an apprentice, my daily role
        involved data cleansing our CRM data, but eventually expanded to AD hoc
        troubleshooting, data formatting and training new starters.</p>
        <p>
          I'm currently looking to further my knowledge and career by branching into
          web and UI development. This is my personal page that I will be treating
          as a semi-curriculum vitae.
